        <h1>MARK ROWELL...how I see things now</h1>
        <p>This page is kind of a journal documenting my feelings and views about my life and the people in it after my catastrophic motorcycle accident in July of 2019.</p>

        <h2>Lorna Marina Coetzee...my angel, caregiver, best friend</h2>


<p>I am truly blessed to have her in my life. We were pretty much done before I crashed. I was tired of being in a relationship. I didn't want to be tied down any longer.
She had moved out and went to Tahoe to live with her son. That didn't work out and she didn't really have anywhere else to go so she moved back in. Seems like now it happened
the way it was supposed to. She wanted me all to herself (her words) and now she has that. Lucky for me. I don't know where I would be if she had not committed to being my 
caregiver. I never asked her to. She just did it. When I woke up in the hospital she was there.  She has been here ever since. 
    When that old bitch pulled out in front of me I was only doing 35-40mph. I flipped over and just landed badly. Broke my neck in 3 places. Traumatic Brain Injury as well.
I was extremely fortunate I kept my mental faculties. The cops and paramedics on scene told Lorna they didn't think I was gonna make it. They life-flighted me
to Valley Med in San Jose. I was there about a month then to the VA (Veterans Administration) hospital in Palo Alto for 2 months.  There Lorna received a few hours 
of training how to care for someone with a spinal cord injury. At first, we struggled with the day to day. It was a dark time for me. A dark time for us.
    
When they discharged me from the VA hospital in Palo Alto I came back to a 2br apartment where Lorna had setup my hospital type bed in the living room that
was partitioned off to give me some privacy. To make it easier to move things, Lorna had pulled up the carpet and put in new hardwood laminate flooring. BY HERSELF! 
    I can't emphasize enough the effort she put into making that overcrowded little apartment functional and comfortable. Because my roommate would routinely steal food, 
cigarettes or anything he could find (We had to put locks on our cupboards) and for the most part we just let it go, he didn't object to my taking over the front room.
My neighbors were nice and helpful at first. One of them even built a ramp for my wheelchair.  That didn't last long. Once it was clear I couldn't do anything to
stand up for myself all respect they had for me went away. They were so scandalous it still infuriates me when I think about it. 
    Now, after a lengthy court battle, we have moved to Felton. We have our home. We have 2 adorable Yorkies. I had purchased a handicap van, really nice. Since we drove
it very little I had only liability coverage and then a fucking tree fell on it. I couldn't believe it! Now its in my driveway and I am trying to find someone to repair it. 
People act like I am lucky and I made out well cuz I got a little bit of money. I would give it all back cuz it was too costly. My life literally sucks now. I can't do 
hardly anything for myself. I can use 1 finger to type, can't really use my hands for anything else. Can't walk, stand, dress or feed myself. Can't go to the bathroom by 
myself. Like a newborn baby. It sucks!! If I could figure out a way that would not hurt Lorna, I would take myself out. I am SOOOO FUCKING tired of living like this.
This IS NOT LIVING. THIS IS JUST WAITING TO DIE.
