    <li>I'm thinking of putting pics of mine and Lorna's life. The struggles we have to overcome daily, and believe me, since my accident, we have had struggles.  To be honest, Lorna had like 5 hours training to care for me. She has been amazing! I don't know where I would be or what I would have done without her. She has been there for me since I woke up in the hospital paralyzed. At the time of my accident, we were on the verge of breaking up. </li>
