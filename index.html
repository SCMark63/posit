        <h1>MARK ROWELL...my life now, after the accident that changed my life!!!</h1>

<div class="span">
        <p>This page is kind of a journal documenting my feelings and views about my life and the people in it after my catastrophic motorcycle accident in July of 2019.</p>
    </div>

        <h2>Lorna Marina Coetzee...my angel, caregiver, best friend...and she sometimes drives me crazy</h2> 

<div class="story">

    <p> We had a complicated relationship even before my accident.  We were pretty much done. I didn't want her living with me. I felt like we had exhausted any paths back. I gotta admit, it had alot to do with the fact I rammed her 360Z, totaling it. I was eventually arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to do great bodily harm. I wore an ankle bracelet (they cut it off my leg in hospital!) and the court ordered me to pay $13,000 in restitution. When I received my settlement I offered on many different occasions to pay it to her. She wouldn't accept it. Said we are in this together. And she does pay some out of her check. Pretty soon it is going to be all on her as my money will be gone soon.  I figure I will die first so I left her the house. She deserves it. She is the only one that has been there. My fault cuz I cut everyone else out of my life. I didn't know how to deal with my situation at first.Funny how things work out. We were talking about things one day and and as it turns out she got what she wanted....me, all to herself (her words, not mine!). I am lucky she stuck around. How could I not fall back in love with her...she said she would take care of me and she does. I'm about as helpless as I can be. I can't use my hands, can't dress myself or feed myself.  What a fucked up life I have now. I was ready to end it after it happened.  She is the reason I didn't.  She makes it bearable. I really don't know what I would do without her. I hope she can stick it out. It is a lot to take on. 7/30/24.
    
    It is now January 5th, 2025. Things have changed  just a bit.  She has convinced herself that I have people come over here and steal stuff........WHENEVER SHE LEAVES THE HOUSE!!! I am thinking she is playing around Oh he'll no! Turns out she actually has nothing but contempt for me...because before my accident I was trying 
to get her out of my house. I didn't want to be in a relationship with her. She was extremely possessive and insecure and a terrible housekeeper. She never worked and that's on me for allowing it. Anyway, I am going to
take out a reverse mortage when I turn 62 and build an additional dwelling unit to provide an income for myself
cuz I am almost at the end of my money and I don't want to have to depend on her for money. She cannot manage $$
at all. I made up a budget and she agreed to it but she will not stick to it. She will put the $$ in the account but then take it and use it for other things. She has had free access to all accounts since I got paid and
insists that she has not been here doing my care with an ulterior motive. Yet when I said I was leaving my house
to Lil Mark she flipped out. Saying she won't pay another dime since she was not getting the house.  She gets paid by In Home Support Services as well as the Vets Administration and doesn't really work much. Sooo, I 
know I rambled alot but I had to put it out there. If I die under suspicious circumstances take a hard look.
 On a different note, I am excited for this country since Trump won. I know he can fix it with God's help.
        Will be back when I can.
