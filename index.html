        <h2>Lorna Marina Coetzee</h2>
<p>The Love of My Life</p>
<ul>
    <li>I am truly blessed to have her in my life. I don't know where I would be if she had not committed to being my caregiver. I never asked her to but she just did it.
        When I crashed into that bitch that pulled out in front of me, I damn near died. The cops and paramedics didn't think I was gonna make it. They life-flighted me
        to Valley Med in San Jose. I was there about a month then to the VA (Veterans Administration) hospital in Palo Alto for 2 months.  There Lorna received a few hours 
        of training how to care for someone with a spinal cord injury. At first, we struggled with the day to day. It was a dark time for me.
