<div class="span">

        <p>This page is kind of a journal documenting my feelings and views about my life and the people in it after my catastrophic motorcycle accident in July of 2019.</p>

        <h2>Lorna Marina Coetzee...my angel, caregiver, best friend...and she sometimes drives me crazy</h2> 
    <p> We had a complicated relationship even before my accident.  We were pretty much done. I didn't want her living with me. I felt like we had exhausted any paths back. Funny how things work out. We were talking about things one day and and as it turns out she got what she wanted....me, all to herself (her words!). I am lucky she stuck around. How could I not fall back in love with her...she said she would take care of me and she does. I about as helpless as I can be. I can't use my hands, can't dress myself or feed myself.  What a fucked up life I have now. I was ready to end it after it happened.  She is the reason I didn't.  She makes it bearable. I really don't know what I would do without her. I hope she can stick it out. It is a lot to take on. 7/30/24. <a>GO TRUMP!!</a>
