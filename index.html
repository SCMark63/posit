        <h1>MARK ROWELL</h1>
        <p>This page is kind of a journal documenting my feelings and views about my life after my catastrophic motorcycle accident in July of 2019.</p>

        <h2>Lorna Marina Coetzee</h2>
<p>The Love of My Life</p>

<p>I am truly blessed to have her in my life. I don't know where I would be if she had not committed to being my caregiver. I never asked her to but she just did it.
        When I crashed into that bitch that pulled out in front of me, I damn near died. The cops and paramedics didn't think I was gonna make it. They life-flighted me
        to Valley Med in San Jose. I was there about a month then to the VA (Veterans Administration) hospital in Palo Alto for 2 months.  There Lorna received a few hours 
        of training how to care for someone with a spinal cord injury. At first, we struggled with the day to day. It was a dark time for me. A dark time for us.
    When they discharged me from the VA hospital in Palo Alto I came back to a 2br apartment where I had my hospital bed setup in the living room (I had a roommate!) that
    was partitioned off to give me some privacy.  I must admit, my roommate was cool about the situation but I'm pretty sure it was because he was intimidated by me.
    My neighbors were nice and helpful at first. One of them even built a ramp for my wheelchair.  That didn't last long. Once it was clear I couldn't do anything to
    stand up for myself all respect they had for me went away. They were so scandalous it still infuriates me when I think about it.
