        <h1>MARK ROWELL...how I see things now</h1>
        <p>This page is kind of a journal documenting my feelings and views about my life and the people in it after my catastrophic motorcycle accident in July of 2019.</p>

        <h2>Lorna Marina Coetzee...my angel, caregiver, best friend</h2>


<p>I am truly blessed to have her in my life. I don't know where I would be if she had not committed to being my caregiver. I never asked her to but she just did it.
When I crashed into that bitch that pulled out in front of me, I damn near died. The cops and paramedics didn't think I was gonna make it. They life-flighted me
to Valley Med in San Jose. I was there about a month then to the VA (Veterans Administration) hospital in Palo Alto for 2 months.  There Lorna received a few hours 
of training how to care for someone with a spinal cord injury. At first, we struggled with the day to day. It was a dark time for me. A dark time for us.
    
When they discharged me from the VA hospital in Palo Alto I came back to a 2br apartment where I had my hospital bed setup in the living room (I had a roommate!) that
was partitioned off to give me some privacy.  Lorna had pulled up the carpet and put in new hardwood laminate flooring. BY HERSELF! I can't emphasize enough the effort she
put into making that overcrowded little apartment functional and comfortable. Because my roommate would routinely steal food, cigarettes or anything he could find (We had to put locks on our cupboards) he didn't object to my taking over the front room.
My neighbors were nice and helpful at first. One of them even built a ramp for my wheelchair.  That didn't last long. Once it was clear I couldn't do anything to
stand up for myself all respect they had for me went away. They were so scandalous it still infuriates me when I think about it.
